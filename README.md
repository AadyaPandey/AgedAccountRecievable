### • Goal of the Dashboard

To build a centralized receivables monitoring tool that:

- Categorizes unpaid invoices by aging buckets.
- Surfaces customer-specific overdue amounts.
- Supports prioritization of high-risk or long-overdue accounts.
- Drives faster, more informed collection strategies.
